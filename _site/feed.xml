There are quite a few thoughts floating around in my head, and a blog seems like a good way to organize ideas and share insights. Think of it like a filing cabinet for my brainspace. Likely, all the topics I mention will fall into two buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology - cloud tech, security, coding, distributed computing, microservices, hypetrain stuff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business - productivity, consulting, current events, hypetrain stuff (cause divination is fun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfishly, this blog is also a side project that will allow me to experiment with a variety of technologies. I’ll keep readers up to date with what’s going on there, but again, that’s probably mostly for my own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, this site is a static web page hosted on AWS Simple Storage Service (S3). The content I write is written to a GitHub repository, compiled and served up using Jekyll and deployed using a Continuous Integration/Delivery process run with CircleCI. All of these services at this point are free (including the static website hosting) and I don’t have to maintain any infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had a mission statement for this blog it would be this: maintain the blog as cheaply as possible with as little effort as possible so that I can focus on content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some basic things that need work. I’m new to Jekyll so right now I have to search how to do every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I don’t have a sidebar for archives and recent posts which would be very nice. I also don’t have any pictures and I’m using the barebones template I took from Jekyll (called minima). Additionally, I’d like to incorporate Disquss comments and Google Analytics into this site, but I’m not exactly sure where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started documenting my trials and tribulations for getting this site set up, but since it’s so specific to my machine and circumstances, I figure it’s kind of pointless to post this in favor of headier, more fun topics. Onwards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="initial" /><summary type="html">As of Feb 2021, approximately 7 million blog posts are created every day. 1 more blog shouldn’t hurt.
