I"Ã<p>If youâ€™ve been following the headlines, youâ€™ll be aware that the US and China appear to be locked in a struggle for global economic dominance. I started thinking more seriously about this after a one-sided debate with my dad (thanks, dad!). He rattled off stats and bold claims about the US and China, and I didnâ€™t really push back because I wasnâ€™t fully caught up on the details. Iâ€™m sure this situation is familiar to many readers.</p>
