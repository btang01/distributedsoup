I"˘$<p>To me, branding has always felt like a fuzzy, overhyped concept. It‚Äôs something that marketers and other consumers obsess over, but that I never really quite understood. However, two books that I recently read back-to-back completely changed by perspective.</p>

<p>One was <em>Shoe Dog</em>, a memoir by Phil Knight, who tells the story of Nike‚Äôs beginnings and the other was a gift from my partner called <em>This is Not a T-shirt</em>, by Bobby Hundreds who built The Hundreds, a streetwear company, from the ground up.</p>

<p>Other than expecting a nice business book read, and a light jaunt into the fashion world, I didn‚Äôt expect much, but these books really made me think about how powerful branding is‚Äìnot just cynically selling products, but building emotional connections, creating communities, and turning simple stuff into cultural icons. It‚Äôs not just fluff, but also strategy, psychology, and storytelling baked into a business‚Äô DNA.</p>

<p>While Nike and The Hundreds are super different (one a global sportswear empire and the other is still a formidable streetwear label with a strong grassroots following), they shared unexpected common threads when it comes to developing brand as a power. Their anecdotes and insights also cut a bit deeper than a 10,000 foot view chatter about a ‚Äúmoat‚Äù or ‚Äúpremium pricing‚Äù.</p>

<p>A brand is a moat, but I learned that it isn‚Äôt a magical one - it can be engineered, but it‚Äôs messy and even if you succeed and transform into a juggernaut, you continue to live on a precarious edge where you can fail at any time.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the sorcery that makes us choose $200 Jordans instead of a $40 generic pair of sneakers? Why would we (ok, or maybe someone else) buy a $50-100 t-shirt from a certain ? It isn‚Äôt actually magic, but it often feels like it. Let‚Äôs jump in‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="nike-three-little-but-powerful-words"><strong>Nike: Three Little, but Powerful Words</strong></h2>
<p>Up until I read the book ‚ÄúShoe Dog‚Äù, I actually thought Nike had been around for over a hundred years - it‚Äôs so ingrained in our culture from before my birth, that from my perspective, it‚Äôs been a bedrock of footwear and athletic-wear from since the beginning of time. But Knight‚Äôs storey revealed that Nike wasn‚Äôt a juggernaut from day one, but it was born as a scrappy startup, launched by a kid who bluffed his way into a distribution deal with a Japanese shoe company, Onitsuka, without having a real company yet.</p>

<p>Knight had to earn his brand equity through vision, a willingness to hustle, but balance that with the capability to deliver results.</p>

<p>However, even a top-tier brand like Nike isn‚Äôt invincible - if you have been paying attention, Nike‚Äôs recent headwinds were a result of their huge direct-to-consumer (DTC) push that began during COVID and while it did boost margins in the short run, hurt their relationships with traditional retail partners. In ‚ÄúThis Is Not a T-Shirt‚Äù, Bobby mentions that retailers aren‚Äôt just distribution channels, but partners that co-sign your product, serve as brand tastemakers that lend credibility and reach to customers.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs other operational considerations like having to shoulder more of the supply-chain burdens of returns, shipping customer service in addition to losing that co-sign effect from specialty stores.</p>

<p>I noticed that in Boston, when I walk into a Marathon Sports store, the epitome of a runner‚Äôs shoe store, there‚Äôs not a checkmark to be found - only Hokas, On, Brooks, Asics, and other shoes that are in my mind, the shoes that runners wear. After having read ‚ÄúShoe Dog‚Äù and really understanding the story of Nike, it actually made me a bit sad that Nike was nowhere in this imaginary conversation that quickly happened in my head - the magic wasn‚Äôt there.</p>

<p>Nike has felt the real effects of this in slipping margins and flattening revenue growth. It‚Äôs a cautionary tale that even a brand as strong as Nike can erode if it loses sight of the communities and relationships that made it that strong in the first place. However, with the return of the previous CEO and a promise to get back to this feeling, I am hopeful for Nike‚Äôs future prospects.</p>

<h2 id="the-hundreds-creating-a-culture-of-credibility"><strong>The Hundreds: Creating a Culture of Credibility</strong></h2>
<p>On a smaller scale, The Hundreds thrives in the streetwear space (a topic that I‚Äôm still trying to ‚Äúget‚Äù). Bobby Hundreds built his brand on skate, graffiti and punk culture, focusing on ‚ÄúPeople Over Product‚Äù to build tight communities that are willing to wait in line for drops and come to the stores even if the products are available online. The Hundres has power through a subculture of crediblity and a brand story that is authentic, and shared every day through their blog.</p>

<p>Particularly interesting was how Bobby Hundreds drives collabrations with artists, other streetwear labels, skaters, and more. When one of his icons, the Adam Bomb, blew up in a good way, he was careful to not tie everything to that character, even though that is what partners and customers demanded. He knew that the fashion world is fickle, and that . A good point he brought up was Gap - who changed branding and packpedaled when a small set of customers complained about this. Would you rather have a friend who constantly agrees with anything you say and avoids conflict at all cost, desprate to fit in‚Ä¶ or would you like a friend that is willing to show you who they are and doesn‚Äôt just constantly shift. The brand feels flat and uncommited, losing the respect and loyalty of the audience.</p>

<h2 id="from-a-cold-start-to-a-humming-business-machine"><strong>From a Cold Start to a Humming Business Machine</strong></h2>
<p>Brand is a power that lasts because customers feel something about a business that rises above a product‚Äôs specifications or price tags. Once people have locked into this feeling, it secures a strong moat.</p>

<p>But a moat by itself isn‚Äôt worth much if you can‚Äôt see it in the numbers. If you zoom right into what a brand does, it lets you charge more (pricing power) and also to sell more (volume) because your buyers believe that you have a business that is special. The proof is in the cash flows, margins, and market share of big brands like Coca-cola, Advil, etc. versus generics.</p>

<p>The whole other layer to this whole branding puzzle is how you jump start this machine in the first place and overcoming the ‚Äúwhy should anyone care about us?‚Äù phase. Nike did this by bluffing (but delivering) its way into legitimacy, The Hundreds staged its first sell-outs, and tech companies like Uber subsidized drivers and riders in every new city until it established its network effects (amongst other a bit questionable methods for growth hacking).</p>

<p>However, the hacks really only work if you can back these actions u pwith substance. Though Knight initially bluffed, he developed a power distribution network to supply his product. Bobby Hundred built a loyal community after the initial placement into key retailers. Uber kept riders because it delivered on excellent customer experience, surpassing taxis in convenience. The cold start gets you noticed, but real brand power sustains your company.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up-strategy-and-soul"><strong>Wrapping Up: Strategy and Soul</strong></h2>
<p>What I learned is that a brand is more than a simple trademark or a flashy campaign. A good brand transforms an everyday purchase into an emotional connection, a feeling that brings consumers back and compels you to participate in its story. Stories like Nike and The Hundreds show this at different scales but demonstrate how this intangible preference can fuel powerful business returns - they also reveal how walking this tightrope is treacherous and how many have failed in this arena. Even today, Nike and the Hundreds both have to fight to stay relevant in a dynamic environment.</p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ what does it mean if you‚Äôre working in solutions architecture, sales or consulting? At first, you might not think building a brand is something that matters to you, but I think nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>Brand power extends beyond sneakers and streetwear. It‚Äôs actually embedded in every decision customers make‚Äìeven in B2B and enterprise sales. Consider how clients respond to names like McKinsey, Bain or BCG (MBB, the Big Three) when trying to develop a strategic plan. You could argue that industry experts in other consulting companies could deliver similar recommendations, but there‚Äôs a brand weight behind the recommendation, a co-sign that carries huge influence.</p>

<p>Similarly, in tech, if you‚Äôre a solutions architect like me, building on AWS, you have the advantage of leaning on a strong brand in cloud computing. So many customers <em>powered by AWS</em> or <em>built on AWS</em> carries some weight, credibility, and trust. Customers co-publishing success stories is similar in some ways to a sneaker being sold in a top-tier running store, an implicit co-sign.</p>

<p>In both sales and consulting, a brand can act as a sort of borrowed trust, where when you walk in, customers might not know you, but they have an expectation based on the company behind you so you‚Äôre not starting from zero and that brand sets the tone before you even start talking.</p>
