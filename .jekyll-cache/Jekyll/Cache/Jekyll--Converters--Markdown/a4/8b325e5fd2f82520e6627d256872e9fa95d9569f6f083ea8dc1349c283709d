I"¥j<h1 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>Over the past 14 years, I‚Äôve collaborated with at least a dozen multi-billion dollar organizations in a wide array of industries<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. One recurrent theme stands out: tech project investments often feels more vibes-driven than being grounded in rigorous financial analysis.</p>

<p>This post will explore why I think it happens, why this is a problem, and offer an approach that tries to account for the idiosyncracies unique to tech and business - to balance intuition and analytics to drive better decisions.</p>

<p>Since this is potentially a controversial topic and I run the risk of upsetting both technical and business-oriented people (maybe even artists as well), I‚Äôll caveat that all the opinions in this blog are my personal observation and don‚Äôt reflect the views of my employer. Let‚Äôs jump in‚Ä¶</p>

<h1 id="why-vibes-driven-investments-are-common"><strong>Why Vibes-driven Investments are Common</strong></h1>
<p>It‚Äôs not that calculations are completely absent, but arguments for projects typically go like this: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll increase revenue by releasing features faster, innovate more, boost customer experience, and cut costs by improving productivity and reducing overhead.‚Äù</p>

<p>There are also a wide array of tools that can pull extensive metadata right out of your data centers and run some calculations that help you estimate how much you might save by getting out of pricy licenses or right-sizing your compute resources (based on industry benchmarks). There are cloud calculators that can incorporate assumptions and nail down estimated costs of each particular service down to thousandths (and beyond) of decimal places.</p>

<p>Though the claims are valid and the data is detailed, these components are usually only brought together for the initial pitch and not crafted in a way where you can sustain it to measure value or to inform the organization‚Äôs strategy over time.</p>

<p>I think there are 3 main reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complexity and Uncertainty Inherent in Technology:</strong>
Real-world IT systems and modern applications are extraordinarily complex - it‚Äôs tough to precisely model the cost and value of every single existing and future component (since the data usually isn‚Äôt collected in an easily consumable way), let alone dial in every risk and benefit of actually executing the project. A McKinsey study found that 70% of digital transformations fail<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and I‚Äôve been around long enough to see what a monumental effort it takes to prevent that failure. The consequences of breezing over execution can be total failure and a leadership overhaul<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. On top of all of this, tech moves fast: innovation cycles and competitive pressures cause leaders to make decisions under tight time constraints - there is a high risk of being disrupted or counter-positioned so leaders also need to rely on a certain amount of vision and intuition to quickly make a decision. In the time it takes to conduct a thorough due diligence analysis of thousands of workloads, you might miss a market window and the juice (the results of the analysis) may not be worth that squeeze. As an SA, one of the most asked questions I get is: what are other similar customers doing and how is it going? It‚Äôs a good question, and an attempt at shortcutting this painful process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vendor-driven Projects:</strong> Many projects I see are based on whichever vendor can pitch the best and with the best price. This is a bit of a roll of the dice since a lot hinges on the vendor‚Äôs ability to sell and cost-competitive does not mean it is the right solution. A good partner should be able to explain assumptions clearly, does the hard work to collaborate with customers to align to strategy and create a rigorous, realistic model. Without this type of expectation (a kind of negotiation really) it‚Äôs difficult to arrive at a realistic solution and you risk overpromised benefits and underdelivered results. During my time in consulting, I saw plenty of pre-sales dreams that turned into implementation nightmares - it was not uncommon for me to be the third or later wave in a revolving door of consultants trying desperately to right the ship.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fear of Accountability:</strong> Given the dangers inherent in 1 and 2, vendors live on a knife edge of trying to win the project but also trying to avoid committing to concrete projections since they could be held accountable for unpredictable outcomes and factors that are hard to measure to begin with. The pain the customers and vendors are trying to avoid is finger-pointing if the project fails to deliver on those promises. The result is a lot of ambiguity and an environment more full of vibes than locked-in numbers (besides available budget) and this can limit future innovation, investments, and ability to adapt when strategies evolve.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Deciding to live with these reasons and accepting this ambiguity means that your organization doesn‚Äôt improve its decision-making mechanism when you <strong>inevitably have to make another tech investment in the future</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="traditional-financial-modeling-basics"><strong>Traditional Financial Modeling Basics</strong></h1>
<p>In contrast, when a company generally makes an investment, they apply some financial tools or metrics to appraise whether or not something is worth pursuing. From buying a soccer team (don‚Äôt do this<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>), to purchasing a factory or acquiring another company, this is typically what is done. Here‚Äôs a crash course from a business standpoint (and across my interactions from developers to managers to directors to VPs to the C-suite, something I‚Äôve surprisingly never seen).</p>

<p>The first basic concepts are using <strong>cost of equity</strong> and <strong>cost of debt</strong> to come up with a <strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)</strong>. What the company needs to return from an investment to satisfy shareholders (those that bought shares of your company) is <strong>cost of equity</strong> and what they need to satisfy debtholders (those who lent you money) is <strong>cost of debt</strong>. The company should use both of those to calculate <strong>WACC</strong> or the hurdle rate, which is the average rate that the company should earn on any new project to figure out if you adding or destroying value. You can factor in taxes to make this even more accurate.</p>

\[WACC = \frac{E}{V} \cdot Re + \frac{D}{V} \cdot Rd \cdot (1 - Tc)\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>( E ): Market value of equity</li>
  <li>( D ): Market value of debt</li>
  <li>( V = E + D ): Total value of capital (equity + debt)</li>
  <li>( Re ): Cost of equity</li>
  <li>( Rd ): Cost of debt</li>
  <li>( Tc ): Corporate tax rate</li>
</ul>

<p>And voil√† - in this simple example you have <strong>WACC</strong>, your hurdle rate, or minimum acceptable rate of return. Typically any project that can return more than this WACC percentage number should create value for the company.</p>

<p>WACC will be the basis of your <strong>discount rate</strong> used in calculating the value of your tech investment.</p>

<p>If you are a finance nerd, you might adjust this <strong>discount rate</strong> if the risk is higher (add a risk premium!) or lower (discount this further!), but if you have a standard WACC as the benchmark, you can just use that as a baseline. However, this is just step 1 and one piece of your investment puzzle.</p>

<p>So what about the project itself? To understand the value, you can figure out the expected yearly <strong>cash flows</strong> of the project, then discount them with a <strong>Net Present Value (NPV)</strong> calculation.</p>

<p>To get the <strong>cash flows</strong>, this is where you make a lot of assumptions about how much revenue you would generate (and how) as well as what costs you would reduce. Combine that altogether to estimate the yearly <strong>cash flows</strong> of your project.</p>

<p>You can then apply the <strong>NPV</strong> formula to figure out what all those cash flows are worth in today‚Äôs dollars over a period of time. You have to remember to factor in your up-front investment, and if you want to be really specific, bake in growth assumptions during the initial year(s) and the terminal value near the end of the period of your project (if it makes sense to do so).</p>

<p>The Net Present Value (NPV) formula is:</p>

\[NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>( C_t ) = Cash flow at time ( t )</li>
  <li>( r ) = Discount rate</li>
  <li>( t ) = Time period</li>
  <li>( n ) = Total number of periods</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have your NPV formula, you still need to figure out whether or not the <strong>Internal Rate of Return</strong> (aka the <strong>IRR</strong>, the rate that makes the NPV = 0) is greater than or less than the WACC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If <strong>IRR &gt; WACC</strong>, then your project beats the company‚Äôs average cost of capital so it makes sense to go ahead.</li>
  <li>If <strong>IRR &lt; WACC</strong>, your project will probably not make sense, unless there is some other intangible strategic goal that you haven‚Äôt factored into your calculation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NPV = 0</strong> just means that you imply that the cash inflow and outflows will be equal. So it‚Äôs the project‚Äôs intrinsic rate of return.</p>

<p>Additionally, you might want to calculate some top-level numbers like <strong>Return on Investment (ROI)</strong> over a certain period of time and understand when your investment breaks even. At this point you‚Äôre slicing and dicing similar concepts.</p>

<p>Clearly there are a lot of assumptions involved, especially due to the complexity/uniqueness of tech projects, so in the next section, I‚Äôll propose a balanced, step-by-step analysis approach.</p>

<p>All of this to say‚Ä¶ pure business analyses is not sufficient - if you treat technology projects and teams as widgets, you ignore factors like tech debt, execution risk, and have a glaring hole that can lead to failure, regardless of your model. Not treating tech debt seriously often comes because you are paralyzed by how much to invest in fixing things (seen as low value) versus releasing new features to the point where your operations slows (or as I have seen) grinds to a halt. There‚Äôs a great article about the importance of tackling debt<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and worth a discussion, but outside the scope of this current post.</p>

<p>And when it comes to just building these financial models, there are a lot of pitfalls<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> you need to avoid and ultimately you still need to weave this all together in a narrative that is built on an informed vision and intuition<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>

<h1 id="balancing-analysis-and-vibes-for-tech-decisions"><strong>Balancing Analysis and Vibes for Tech Decisions</strong></h1>
<p>So if the soft tech estimate is not enough and the pure business calculation is too in-the-weeds and can fall apart quickly, what can we do?</p>

<p>Ultimately, the key question we want to answer is: <strong>do I invest or not?</strong> And this is based on the question: <strong>if I invest, what do I expect to return from this investment?</strong></p>

<p>And valuation of this investment is only one part of the equation. You also have to take into account whether this aligns with a good strategy<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. What problem will this solve for me at an organizational level - and based on competitive dynamics, will this help me in the long run? For instance, how might it reduce my costs, grow my revenue, improve my moat? It‚Äôs common for me to see pitches where both the strategy is poorly defined, the costs are too broadly constructed and assumed, and there‚Äôs usually very little on the revenue generation side. While it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that the immediate benefits are hard to measure, I do agree with the sentiment that, ultimately, ‚Äúif there no benefits, then the investment is not strategic‚Äù.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>

<p>I came across an article by Rita McGrath, a Columbia Business school professor, who <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> advocates for an approach where you focus on <strong>option value</strong> and flexibility instead of moving too far into projecting cash flows far out in the future. She calls out the shortcomings of NPV analysis in tech projects which includes the uncertainty, the strategic value and critiques the rigidity of NPV analysis.</p>

<p>What she calls out actually resonates with the way I‚Äôve seen my colleagues and go-to-market teams position tech projects which is to:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Start small and scale</strong>, by thinking about the big picture but piloting small cloud migration projects with a targeted set of personas and then building out to more and more teams after you have proven some value.</li>
  <li><strong>Measure leading indicators of success</strong>, by using some non-financial metrics to show that value: this could be adoption rates, increased customer retention, reduced churn, higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS) or Customer Satisfaction Scores (CSAT) that can be tied to the project, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize investments that allow you to adapt</strong>, by aiming for solutions that allow you scale and adapt.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should determine what some leading indicators of success could be - it should align with your goals. Depending on the goals it could be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adoption and usage metrics</li>
  <li>Transactions uptick in a new market, lower churn and higher retention</li>
  <li>Ability to meet industry benchmarks or exceed past product time-to-market</li>
  <li>Customer satisfaction scores are improving via <strong>Net Promoter Scores (NPS)</strong> or <strong>Customer Satisfaction Scores (CSAT)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Once the pilot is done, you should be in a better place to take a stab at the cash flow and then follow up with a better <strong>NPV</strong> analysis and high level narrative to hold it altogether. You can also branch off in a similar manner to scale in a step-wise fashion.</p>

<p>And if you aren‚Äôt capturing those today, at least have a plan to track these over time to back up the hypothesis that this is a good idea. This isn‚Äôt just a thought exercise question, but also will help you justify further investment in innovations and operational improvements down the line, something that I have seen organizations struggle with. Not treating tech debt seriously often comes because you are paralyzed by how much to invest in fixing things (seen as low value) versus releasing new features to the point where your operations slows (or as I have seen) grinds to a halt.</p>

<p>Sure, you can shortcut the whole decision-making process and lean on industry analyses like this one from McKinsey that sees 10-15% revenue uplift, achieving 30% faster time-to-market (TTM) from companies that migrate to the cloud (via improving customer experiences and operational agility). There are also additional data points that you can use as benchmarks from the IDC <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. These are all great benchmarks that ensure that you are moving in the right direction, but it‚Äôs still important to put a plan in place to track data points and detect improvements because <strong>you are not necessarily the industry average</strong>.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a more rigorous approach that helps us align this project with the organization‚Äôs strategy</p>
<ol>
  <li>Calculate the <strong>Net Present Value (NPV)</strong> of the project based on the future cash flows discounted to dollars today.</li>
  <li>Calculate the <strong>Payback Period</strong> - this will help us understand when we break even from our initial investment and start recouping those costs</li>
  <li>Determine how the investment will support our <strong>strategic goals</strong> (gives us a competitive advantage, helps us break into a $10B market in 3 years that we could not enter before, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Combining business and technology perspectives will help us balance out this key decisions - ignoring these principles on either side leads to low impact projects, cost overruns, missed opportunities.</p>

<h1 id="example-applying-real-options-thinking-to-a-cloud-migration"><strong>Example: Applying Real Options Thinking to a Cloud Migration</strong></h1>
<p>Bringing these complex ideas in a simple example helps, so suppose your company is thinking about migrating to the cloud.</p>

<p>The first step might be to consider a small pilot project - for example, spending $200k to migrate a business critical application to the cloud. You might have to do a bit of bottoms-up estimation to break down cost of database workloads, application hosting costs, etc. From the top-down you use the industry benchmarks and tools that lean on those benchmarks to serve as a sanity check<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The pilot phase mitigates risks by letting you test without committing your full budget up front. During this time, you can assess the app performance in the cloud and see how your leading indicators of performance are doing. You can use this information to extrapolate the long term benefits.</p>

<p>They would need to understand their current state. Their on-premises data center may cost $500,000 per year in energy, maintenance, staffing. And they do a hardware refresh of about $1M every 5 years or so. Use the data that you have to determine the value of the project. Understand the cash flows from the project by using the savings between on-premises cost and the annual cloud cost. Factor in initial costs of the project for year 0. Then you have to assume growth in the near term and long-term (or terminal). For example, your cloud cost might initially grow 10% annually due to more workloads. Savings may grow 5% annually due to better efficiency and reduced overhead when working with the cloud. Then long term, you might have a terminal value that assumes perpetual growth at 2% at the end of say 10 years. You have to have a discount rate, so you might use a cost of capital value of 8%</p>

<p>After the pilot stage, you have 3 different options:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Scale</strong> out your initiative:</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust</strong> the approach: you determine there is some value, but can benefit from taking a different approach to migrating<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Terminate</strong> the project: In this case, you‚Äôve capped your initial investment losses.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the <strong>real options</strong> approach using probabilities to calculate an Expected Value (EV). The benefit of this is that you can use this knowledge in the future for more decisions.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Success Probability could be 60%</li>
  <li>Partial Success Probability could be 30% and you learn how to adjust</li>
  <li>Failure probability might be 10%</li>
</ul>

<p>So:</p>

\[EV = (60\% \times $240,000) + (30\% \times $100,000) + (10\% \times (-$200,000))\]

<p>Simplifying:</p>

\[EV = $144,000 + $30,000 - $20,000 = $154,000\]

<p>You have the ability to expand or adjust based on the information. As part of this exercise, you‚Äôll likely identify areas where you do not have the data, but then this is time to get those processes and tools in place.</p>

<p>This approach balances NPV and EV with some flexibility. It also incorporates strategies like starting with high-value applications, optimizing costs while you are migrating and leaning on past experiences. It helps you manage risks and also better link the project to your business goals and this staged investment is based on data which cap your downside risks. Beyond the pure financials, the pilot and scale approach gives you the opportunity to learn, to build your capabilities and create a baseline to scale sustainably in the future.</p>

<p>As you get better data using all the tools and metrics at your disposal, construct the NPV and the narrative to create a better tie to long-term value.</p>

<h1 id="closing-thoughts"><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h1>
<p>Customers struggle with performing their own exhaustive modeling (IRR, NPV, ROI) in-house because it takes a lot of effort, time, requires deep-expertise, and might still fall short of the accuracy that they want, versus taking a quick cut at some estimates, looking at the benchmarks and then just ‚Äúdoing the thing‚Äù. The nature of tech means that some drawbacks of pure NPV analysis<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> are amplified.</p>

<p>For truly big acquisitions (valued in the billions), companies will usually bring in a third party to arbitrate and perform due diligence. However, even tech projects can benefit from a similar type of discipline. By blending strategic alignment, all the analytical tools at your disposal, and incorporating flexibility with real options thinking, I think there is a way forward to minimizing uncertainty and realizing measurable value for tech projects.</p>

<p>I think a good approach is to blend a bit of your experience and intuition, take a stab at creating a financial model so you at least know where your gaps are for things you need to measure. This hypothesis-driven way forward will help to establish your long term capabilities and future forays into more innovation. There‚Äôs also a great resource in Educase that outlines an approach in more detail<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
