I"Å<p>Since my last post about 4 years ago, the world has changed quite a bit: an AI revolution has taken a grip over the worldâ€™s collective imagination and the terrible impact of COVID is now viewed (by most) as a quaint speedbump in our rearview, and the average 30-year fixed rate that bottomed at about 3% in 2021 is now closer to 7% today (the debate of the Fed funds rate vs. mortgage rates is actually quite a <a href="https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2024/09/fed-up-with-fed-talk-central-banks.html">complicated topic</a>). Despite all these macro-level events, I think a good strategy to help navigate all this craziness as a company or even as an individual still remains very much the same.</p>
