<p>As of Feb 2021, approximately 7 million blog posts are created every day. 1 more blog shouldn‚Äôt hurt. There are quite a few thoughts floating around in my head, and a blog seems like a good way to organize ideas and share insights. Think of it like a filing cabinet for my brainspace. Likely, all the topics I mention will fall into two buckets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Technology - cloud tech, security, coding, distributed computing, microservices, industry trends (hop on board the hype train)</li>
  <li>Business - productivity, consulting, current events, industry trends</li>
</ol>

<p>Having lived most of my career at the intersection of business and technology, I have seen how the two have more closely coincided in a way that ultimately makes my list above non-MECE. I‚Äôd like to peel back the layers of buzzwords like BlockchainAIMachineLearningCryptoIoT, ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù, etc. and observe them with a skeptical eye from both lenses - the geeky in-depth understanding of what these things are and how they work, as well as the meaning of these concepts from a business sense.</p>

<p>Selfishly, this blog is also a side project that will allow me to experiment with a variety of technologies. I‚Äôll keep readers up to date with what‚Äôs going on there, but again, that‚Äôs probably mostly for my own benefit.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, this site is a static web page hosted on AWS Simple Storage Service (S3). The content I write is written to a GitHub repository, compiled and served up using Jekyll and deployed using a Continuous Integration/Delivery process run with CircleCI. All of these services at this point are free (including the static website hosting) and I don‚Äôt have to maintain any infrastructure.</p>

<p>If I had a mission statement for this blog it would be this: maintain the blog as cheaply as possible with as little effort as possible so that I can focus on content.</p>

<p>There are still some basic things that need work. I‚Äôm new to Jekyll so right now I have to search how to do every little thing, which is kind of painful, but pretty much par for the course when learning new tools.</p>

<p>For example, I don‚Äôt have a sidebar for archives and recent posts which would be very nice. I also don‚Äôt have any pictures and I‚Äôm using the barebones template I took from Jekyll (called minima). Additionally, I‚Äôd like to incorporate Disquss comments and Google Analytics into this site, but I‚Äôm not exactly sure where to start.</p>

<p>I started documenting my trials and tribulations for getting this site set up, but since it‚Äôs so specific to my machine and circumstances, I figure it‚Äôs kind of pointless to post this in favor of headier, more fun topics. Onwards.</p>
