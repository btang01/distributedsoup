I"H<p>As of Feb 2021, approximately 7 million blog posts are created every day. 1 more blog shouldnâ€™t hurt. There are quite a few thoughts floating around in my head, and a blog seems like a good way to organize ideas and share insights. Think of it like a filing cabinet for my brainspace. Likely, all the topics I mention will fall into two buckets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Technology - cloud tech, security, coding, distributed computing, microservices, industry trends (hop on board the hype train)</li>
  <li>Business - productivity, consulting, current events, industry trends</li>
</ol>
