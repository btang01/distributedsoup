Recently, I read a couple of books that got me thinking about branding, a fluffy topic that's typically outside my wheelhouse. One was "Shoe Dog", a memoir by Phil Knight, the creator of Nike. The other was "This is Not a T-shirt", also a memoir by Bobby Hundreds, founder of The Hundreds streetwear.

While these two companies are really different - one is a footwear, athletic-wear juggernaut and the other is a streetwear focused shop with a more grassroots approach to entrepreneurship, there were a lot of great lessons and perspectives on how to build a business, especially when thinking about the power of brands.

When we talk about brand power, we often throw around words like "moat" or "pricing premium", and treat brand as a magical force. What's the sorcery that makes us choose $200 Jordans instead of a $40 generic pair of sneakers? Why would we (ok, or maybe someone else) buy a $50-100 t-shirt from a trusted brand? It isn't actually magic, but it often feels like it.

## **Nike: The Power of Three Words**
Up until I read the book "Shoe Dog", I actually thought Nike had been around for over a hundred years - it's so ingrained in our culture from before my birth, that from my perspective, it's been a bedrock of footwear and athletic-wear from since the beginning of time. 

However, even a top-tier brand like Nike isn't invincible - if you have been paying attention, Nike's recent headwinds were a result of their huge direct-to-consumer (DTC) push that began during COVID and while it did boost margins in the short run, hurt their relationships with traditional retail partners. In "This Is Not a T-Shirt", Bobby mentions that retailers aren't just distribution channels, but partners that co-sign your product, serve as brand tastemakers that lend credibility and reach to customers. 

There's other operational considerations like having to shoulder more of the supply-chain burdens of returns, shipping customer service in addition to losing that co-sign effect from specialty stores.

I noticed that in Boston, when I walk into a Marathon Sports store, the epitome of a runner's shoe store, there's not a checkmark to be found - only Hokas, On, Brooks, Asics, and other shoes that are in my mind, the shoes that runners wear. After having read "Shoe Dog" and really understanding the story of Nike, it actually made me a bit sad that Nike was nowhere in this imaginary conversation that quickly happened in my head - the magic wasn't there.

Nike has felt the effects of this in slipping margins and flattening revenue growth. However, with the return of the previous CEO and a promise to get back to this feeling, I am hopeful for Nike's future prospects.

## **The Hundreds: Creating a Culture of Credibility**
On a smaller scale, The Hundreds thrives in the streetwear space (a topic that I'm still trying to "get"). Bobby Hundreds built his brand on skate, graffiti and punk culture, focusing on "People Over Product" to build tight communities that are willing to wait in line for drops and come to the stores even if the products are available online. The Hundres has power through a subculture of crediblity and a brand story that is authentic, and shared every day through their blog. 

Particularly interesting was how Bobby Hundreds drives collabrations with artists, other streetwear labels, skaters, and more. When one of his icons, the Adam Bomb, blew up in a good way, he was careful to not tie everything to that character, even though that is what partners and customers demanded. He knew that the fashion world is fickle, and that . A good point he brought up was Gap - who changed branding and packpedaled when a small set of customers complained about this. Would you rather have a friend who constantly agrees with anything you say and avoids conflict at all cost, desprate to fit in... or would you like a friend that is willing to show you who they are and doesn't just constantly shift. The brand feels flat and uncommited, losing the respect and loyalty of the audience.

## **From Theory to Income Statements**
Brand is a power that lasts because customers feel something about a business that rises above a product's specifications or price tags. Once people have locked into this feeling, it secures a strong moat.

But a moat by itself isn't worth much if you can't see it in the numbers. If you zoom right into what a brand does, it lets you charge more (pricing power) and also to sell more (volume) because your buyers believe that you have a business that is special. The proof is in the cash flows, margins, and market share of big brands like Coca-cola, Advil, etc. versus generics.

## **Wrapping Up: Strategy and Soul**
Brand is more than some trademark or a flash-in-the-pan campaign. A good brand transforms an everyday purchase into an emotional connection, a feeling that brings consumers back and becomes a financial driver. Stories like Nike and The Hundreds show this at different scales but shows how this intangible preference can fuel powerful business returns - they also reveal how walking this tightrope is treacherous and how many have failed in this arena. Even today, Nike and the Hundreds both have to fight to stay relevant in a dynamic environment.
