In the recent spate of earnings reports, a familiar pattern emerged across large U.S. technology companies. Earnings beat expectations, revenue growth remained solid, and yet the equity market reactions have been muted to even outright negative.

The headline explanation is all over my LinkedIn, YouTube, and other social media feeds: investors are reacting to the scale and persistence of AI-driven capex, now approaching roughly $600B across a small group of incumbents. There is growing anxiety over whether this capex will ultimately pay off.

I think this statement is directionally correct, but still a bit too hand-wavy. Being more precise about what this actually means helps clarify how strong execution, macroeconomic conditions and sentiment can coexist with restrained valuations. Large-cap tech may still be expensive by historical measures, but what matters here is that valuations have stopped rising in response to good news. Understanding why that happens has less to do with mood and more to do with how cash flows are being discounted.

This post digs into valuation mechanisms and how they connect to the broader macro backdrop, with the goal of understanding what would actually need to change for strong operating performance to drive valuation expansion once again, rather than being acknowledged and then quickly discounted.
